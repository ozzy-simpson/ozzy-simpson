## About Me

I recently graduated **_summa cum laude_ from The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., with a B.S. in Computer Science**. As a **CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service recipient**, I'm currently **pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science with a focus in computer security and information assurance** at GW for a fifth year, and expect to graduate in May 2026. This past summer I worked as a research assistant in the [GW Usable Security and Privacy Lab](https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu/), where I worked on their Privacy Label Observatory and custom-built survey technology.

- My interests include **cybersecurity, software engineering, and AI/ML**.
- I've interned at **Capital One** as a software engineer and was an **LA/UTA** at GWU for three years before becoming a **GTA** during my master's program.
- I started coding as a kid, launching a **web design business** at age 10.
- When I’m not coding, you’ll find me **skiing, running, rock climbing, or hunting for the best vegan sushi.**
